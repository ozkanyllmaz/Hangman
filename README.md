## Overview
The Hangman Game allows players to guess a hidden word by entering letters. If the player guesses incorrectly too many times, they lose the game. If they guess the word correctly, they win.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the game interface.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to the game, making it visually appealing.

## How to Play
1. Start the game by typing a letter on your keyboard.
2. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position.
3. If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
4. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word or the hangman is fully drawn.
5. You can restart the game by clicking the "Play Again" button after winning or losing.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file used for styling the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## Future Improvements
- Add more words to the word list.
- Implement difficulty levels.
- Enhance the user interface with animations and sound effects.
